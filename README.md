- 👋 Hi, I’m @jsonpj3wt
- 👀 I’m interested in building and managing software teams, while still keeping relevant in cloud-based architecture, open-source software, and all-around coding!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning AWS BI Architecture, Payement Gateway Integration, Corporate software management (integrations, ETLs, and such), and looking at Rust.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on cool serverless approaches.
- 📫 How to reach me here!
